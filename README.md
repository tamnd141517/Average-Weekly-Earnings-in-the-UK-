# Average-Weekly-Earnings-in-the-UK-
Identification, estimation, and diagnostic checking to find out the relationship and economic implications behind the result of analyzing the dependent and independent variables.
</p> This paper uses the Average Weekly Earnings (AWE) on the base of the Manufacturing level in the UK as the outcome variable. The primary explanatory variable is the total actual weekly hours worked in the UK. 
</p> These data is collected from the Office of National Statistics (https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/timeseries/k5ca/lms)
</p> The first part of this project will explore the outcome Yt as an Autoregressive process. The next step is to consider an additional explanatory variable, and estimate
the Dynamic Causal Effects of this explanatory variable on the outcome. Next, test two variables for Cointegration, in a formal test of whether they move together and receive the same shocks. Finally, I will estimate a model testing for Volatility Clustering in your time series Yt using the Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) and Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models.
